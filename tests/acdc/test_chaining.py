tests.acdc.test_chaining module

Tests for keri.acdc.chaining: the three-valued verdict an ACDC edge evaluates to,
and the m-ary reducers that aggregate an Edge-group's members into one.

Storage-free by construction. A verdict is a value, not control flow, so these
tests need no KEL, no registry, no LMDB and no fixtures -- which is the point of
putting the reduction here rather than in either verifier's disposition loop.
