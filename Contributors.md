# Contributors' Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to keripy's contribution guide! This project aims to develop a reference implementation of the keri standards and protocols developed in WebOfTrust on github.. We deeply appreciate the time and effort of contributors like you!

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Read the README.md (best quickstart guide for using the project) and can build, install, and test keripy yourself from those instructions.
- Are somewhat familiar with the KERI, ACDC, CESR standards and the KERI whitepaper (this is a very new project at some point when the tool is more useable we may be able to skip this step but familiarizing yourself with all these concepts will ease your contributions into the project.
