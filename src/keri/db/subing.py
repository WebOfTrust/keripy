KERI
keri.db.subing module

Provide variety of mixin classes for LMDB sub-dbs with various behaviors.

Principally:

Suber class provides put, pin, get, rem and getItemIter method for managing
a serialized value in a sub db with an iterable set of keys defining the key space

CesrSuber class extends Suber for values that are serializations of CESR serializable
object instances. Ducktyped subclasses of Matter, Indexer, and Counter or the like.

IoSetSuber class extends Suber to allow a set of values to be stored in insertion
order at each effective key. Only one copy of a unique value is allowed in the
set at a given effective key. The effective key suffixes an ordinal to the key
space to track insertion ordering. IoSetSuber adds additional methods to manage
IoSets of values.

CatCesrSuber adds the ability to store multiple concatenated serializations at
a value

CatCesrIoSetSuber combines the capabilities

Other special classer for special values

SerderSuber stores Serialized Serder Instances of in JSON, CBOR, or MGPK

Also for Secrets private keys
SignerSuber
CryptSignerSuber

Also for using the dupsort==true mechanism is
DupSuber
CesrDupSuber
