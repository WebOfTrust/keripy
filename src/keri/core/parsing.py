    Parser is stream parser that processes an incoming message stream.
    Each message in the stream is composed of a message body with a message foot
    The message body includes a version string. The message foot is composed of
    composable concatenated attachments encoded in CESR (Composable Event
    Streaming Representation)  CESR supports both binary and text formats where
    text is Base64 URL/Filesafe. The attachements in a CESR foot may be converted
    and round tripped en-masse between binary and text (Base64 URL/File).
    CESR encoding ensures alignment on 24 bit boundaries.

                sets each of a serialized message with attached cryptographic
                material such as signatures or receipts.

            framed is Boolean, True means ims contains only one frame of msg plus
                counted attachments instead of stream with multiple messages

            pipeline is Boolean, True means use pipeline processor to process
                ims msgs when stream includes pipelined count codes.

        New Logic:
