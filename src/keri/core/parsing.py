class Parser:
    """Parser is stream parser that processes an incoming message stream.
    Each message in the stream is composed of a message body with a message foot
    The message body includes a version string. The message foot is composed of
    composable concatenated attachments encoded in CESR (Composable Event
    Streaming Representation)  CESR supports both binary and text formats where
    text is Base64 URL/Filesafe. The attachements in a CESR foot may be converted
    and round tripped en-masse between binary and text (Base64 URL/File).
    CESR encoding ensures alignment on 24 bit boundaries.

    Only supports current version VERSION

    Has the following public attributes and properties:

    Attributes:
        ims (bytearray): incoming message stream
        framed (bool): True means stream is packet framed
        piped (bool): True means use pipeline processor to process

        local (bool): True means event source is local (protected) for validation
                         False means event source is remote (unprotected) for validation

        with attached crypto material (signature etc) from incoming message
        stream, ims, and dispatches processing of message with attachments.

        Uses .ims when ims is not provided.

        Iterator yields when not enough bytes in ims to finish one msg plus
        attachments. Returns (which raises StopIteration) when finished.

        Parameters:
            ims (bytearray): serialized incoming message stream.
                May contain one or more sets each of a serialized message with
                attached cryptographic material such as signatures or receipts.
            framed (bool): True means ims contains only one frame of msg plus
                counted attachments instead of stream with multiple messages
            piped (bool): True means use pipeline processor to process
                ims msgs when stream includes pipelined count codes.
            kvy (Kevery): route KERI KEL message types to this instance
            tvy (Tevery): route TEL message types to this instance
            exc (Exchanger): route EXN message types to this instance
            rvy (Revery): reply (RPY) message handler
            vry (Verifier): ACDC credential processor
            local (bool): True means event source is local (protected) for validation
                          False means event source is remote (unprotected) for validation
                          None means use default .local
            version (Versionage): default version of CESR to use.
                                  None means do not change default

        Logic:
            Currently only support couters on attachments not on combined or
            on message
            Attachments must all have counters so know if txt or bny format for
            attachments. So even when framed==True must still have counter.
            Do While loop
               sniff to set up first extraction
                  raise exception and flush full tream if stream start is counter
                  must be message
               extract message
               sniff for counter
               if group counter extract and discard but keep track of count
               so if error while processing attachments then only need to flush
