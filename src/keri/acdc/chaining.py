keri.acdc.chaining module

Edge Section verdicts and the m-ary Operator reductions over them.

An ACDC edge is decided on two axes: the unary Operator's relation between the near
and far nodes, and the far node itself -- whether it is in hand, whether it satisfies
the schemas pinned on the edge and its enclosing groups, and what its registry says
about it. An m-ary Operator aggregates members, so both axes have to reach it as one
value or the Operator does not mean what the ACDC specification says it means. An
`OR` whose second member is merely absent must not escrow the near ACDC, because the
group is already satisfied; that is only expressible if "absent" is a verdict rather
than a control-flow jump out of the loop.

So this module holds no storage and no policy. It defines the verdict a member
evaluates to, the reductions the Edge-group Operators perform over them, and nothing
else. Each caller maps its own evidence into verdicts and disposes of the reduced one
its own way -- v1 escrows and cues, the v2 IPEX path escrows through the Exchanger --
which is why the mapping and the disposition stay with the callers while the algebra
lives here.

Three values, not four. An unknown verdict carries a retryability bit instead:
"the evidence has not arrived" and "this implementation cannot evaluate the Operator"
sit in the same place in the lattice and differ only in what the caller should do, so
a flag keeps every reduction's table three rows wide rather than four.
